## Project Plan

### TODO Items

- [ ] Decide a `Team Name`


- [ ] Add `User Stories` and `Specification` (Functional/Non-Functional): Overall Requirements for the project

> -> Reference from the pre-written project plan

- [ ] Add `Prototype`: At least two graphical examples that demonstrate a page, chart, board, level, flowchart, or layout.

- [ ] Add `Architecture` - High Level: A description of your initial thoughts on the structure of the software

> -> Provide Two Selections - 1. Host a Flask Web Server 2. Serverless Function

- [ ] Add `Use Cases` and `Message Sequence Chart`: A description of what your program does from the user's perspective.

> -> Communication Between Frontend, Web Backend Server, Web Crawler, End Points (website)

- [ ] Add `APIs list` for both Web Backend and Web Crawler Server

> -> Web Server: GET/POST Request || Web Crawler: getDFSData and getBFSData 

- [ ] Add `Technologies Chosen` and `Development tools`: An initial listing of which software libraries, languages, development tools, and other systems will be required to create and use the software.

- [ ] Add `Learning Materials and Question`: List all possible questions for the specific technologies and learning goal in the first two weeks

> -> Collect Questions such as: How to call Google Cloud Function through NodeJS backend web server?

- [ ] Add `Division of Work`: A thorough and complete description of what each Team member will be accomplishing, including who will produce each type of documentation needed (see the Mid-Point and Final Report assignments for more).

> -> Decide the work between **Crawler Developer**, **Data Transfer/Web Backend Developer**, **DevOps**, **FrontEnd Developer** and **Data Visualizer**

- [ ] Add `Plan and Schedule`: A list that describes how much time each Team member will be spending on their portion of the Project. The amount spent per Team member must be roughly equivalent and should be at least 100 hours each. Expand the Project accordingly to make the work amounts equivalent, and make sure the Project is sufficiently complex.

> -> 15 hours/week at least

- [ ] Add `Results` and `Conclusion`

## Future Tasks

### Mid-Point Project Check

For this assignment, after several weeks of development, you must submit `something functional`. 

There are two things required here:

- Functional code that might be buggy and will be incomplete. In the case of web or online server-based projects, you must also submit a `URL/instructions describing where to go to see your already-hosted project`. For other projects that are not hosted online, include compilation instructions, as needed.

- Instructions on how to examine, use, play with, visit, and/or manipulate your project, and what highlights should be looked for.

A grade will be assigned (for this assignment) based on subjective analysis of how much work has been accomplished and how impressive it is so far. You will not be judged on your instructions based on their quality, but on how well they describe how to examine what you've done. Make them clear and easy to follow! Look at this example from a previous term for a good idea of what to do.

### Create Final Report

Your text report must consist of the following complete and thorough features, each of which is worth up to 7 points each:

- A description of what your program does from the user's perspective.

- Clear usage instructions, including at least two graphical examples of some element of your project. Remember to include URLs that should be visited or compilation instructions, as necessary.

- A description of how the software and systems function together.

- A listing of which software libraries, languages, APIs, development tools, servers, and other systems you used to create the software, and deeper discussions of any of those you want to talk more about.

- A description of what each Team member accomplished.

- An introduction and closing sections.

If your project has majorly deviated from your Project plan (which is ok!), include a section detailing the reasons and outcome.

Reports must be a `minimum of 8 pages` to receive full points. See here for a great example, and one of my favorite projects.

Write this report as if someone reading it has not yet used your software, or perhaps never will (i.e., this report is separate and distinct from your project). A grade for this assignment will be given based on subjective analysis of the quality and thoroughness of your report in regards to the above sections.

### Create Poster

Your poster must include the following:

- Your team member's names
- A simple prose description of what your project does
- At least one screenshot showing your code
- At least one screenshot of your project in action

Consider including the following optional elements:

- Flow charts and other design graphics
- Pictures of your team members (especially if you are planning on coming to the Career Showcase)
- Bullet points highlighting interesting features and examples

Remember: all images in the poster should be high resolution.
